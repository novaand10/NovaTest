Balance Bracket
Here's a detailed explanation of the implementation:

The IsBalanced function takes a string s that contains bracket characters.

We use a stack (Stack<char>) to store opening bracket characters ((, [, {) as we encounter them in the string.

When we encounter a closing bracket (), ], }):

We check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there are more closing brackets than opening ones, so we return "NO".
We pop the top character from the stack and check if it matches the expected opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If they do not match (e.g., ')' does not match with '('), we return "NO".
After processing all characters in the string:

If the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have been properly matched with closing brackets, so we return "YES".
If the stack is not empty, it means there are more opening brackets than closing ones remaining, so we return "NO".
Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. Each character is processed once, and stack operations (Push, Pop, Count) are O(1) on average.

Space Complexity: O(n), in the worst case where all characters are opening brackets, the stack will contain all characters of the input string.

Explanation Summary:
The function efficiently determines if a string of brackets is balanced using a stack to track unmatched opening brackets. It ensures that every closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket, providing a clear and optimal solution to the problem.
